# PyStout
A Package To Make Publication Quality Latex Tables From Python Regression Output

Current issues with the code:

1. It only prints tables that you explicitly define. Need to work on getting regression output into a table.
2. The process for doing mgroups is clunky. Since it is defined as a dictionary, it does not allow for multiple non-groups (do we care about this flexibility?)
3. Lots of other stuff
